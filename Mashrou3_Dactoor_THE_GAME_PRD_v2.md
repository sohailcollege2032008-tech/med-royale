# Mashrou3 Dactoor THE GAME — Technical PRD v2

## 1. Product Overview

**Name:** Mashrou3 Dactoor THE GAME
**Type:** Real-time competitive quiz web application (like Kahoot but "first correct answer wins the point")
**Tech Stack:** React (Vite) + Supabase (Auth with Google OAuth, Realtime, Database, Storage) + Tailwind CSS + Google Gemini API (for file-to-JSON conversion)
**Target Users:** Medical students (Arabic-speaking, up to ~100 concurrent players per session)
**Deployment:** Vercel (frontend) + Supabase Free Tier (backend)

### Core Concept
A host creates a quiz room, uploads questions (JSON directly, or any document file like PDF/PPTX/DOCX that gets auto-converted to JSON via Gemini AI), and starts the game. Players sign in with Google, join via a room code, and must be approved by the host. Questions appear one at a time — the **first** player to answer correctly scores the point. The host controls question progression.

## 2. User Roles & Authorization Hierarchy

### Owner (المالك) — Super Admin
- **Hardcoded email:** `sohailcollege2032008@gmail.com`
- Only ONE owner exists in the system
- Can add or remove host emails via an **Owner Dashboard**
- Can see all rooms, all hosts, all activity
- Is automatically also a host (can create and run games)

### Host (المضيف) — Authorized Quiz Masters
- Must be explicitly added by the Owner (by email)
- Signs in via Google OAuth — system checks if their email is in the `authorized_hosts` table
- Can create game rooms, upload/manage questions, run games
- Can approve or reject player join requests for their rooms
- Has a personal **Question Bank** (saved question sets they can reuse)
- Cannot add other hosts (only the Owner can)

### Player (اللاعب) — Participants
- Signs in via Google OAuth (mandatory — no anonymous access)
- Can browse available rooms and request to join
- Must wait for host approval before entering the game lobby
- If rejected by host, CANNOT send another join request for that specific room
- Sees each question, answers, sees leaderboard, sees final results

### Authorization Flow Summary
```
Owner (sohailcollege2032008@gmail.com)
  └── adds Host emails to authorized_hosts table
        └── Host signs in with Google → verified against authorized_hosts
              └── Host creates room → Players request to join
                    └── Host approves/rejects each request
                          └── Approved players enter lobby
```

## 3. Authentication System

### Google OAuth Setup (Supabase Auth)

All users (Owner, Hosts, Players) sign in with Google. The system determines their role post-login:

```
User signs in with Google
  → Fetch email from auth.users
  → IF email === 'sohailcollege2032008@gmail.com' → role = 'owner'
  → ELSE IF email IN authorized_hosts → role = 'host'
  → ELSE → role = 'player'
```

**Supabase Auth Config:**
- Enable Google OAuth provider in Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Providers → Google
- Set up Google Cloud OAuth consent screen + credentials
- Redirect URL: `https://your-project.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`

**Client-side login:**
```js
const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.signInWithOAuth({
  provider: 'google',
  options: {
    redirectTo: window.location.origin + '/auth/callback'
  }
})
```

**Post-login role resolution:**
```js
async function getUserRole(userId) {
  const { data: { user } } = await supabase.auth.getUser()
  const email = user.email

  if (email === 'sohailcollege2032008@gmail.com') return 'owner'

  const { data: host } = await supabase
    .from('authorized_hosts')
    .select('id')
    .eq('email', email)
    .single()

  return host ? 'host' : 'player'
}
```

---

## 4. Question Upload System (JSON + AI File Conversion)

### Method 1: Direct JSON Upload
The host uploads a `.json` file with this exact structure:

```json
{
  "title": "MSK Anatomy Quiz - Batch 62",
  "questions": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "question": "Which muscle is the primary flexor of the elbow?",
      "question_ar": "إيه العضلة الأساسية اللي بتعمل flexion للكوع؟",
      "choices": [
        "Biceps brachii",
        "Brachioradialis",
        "Brachialis",
        "Pronator teres"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "time_limit": 15,
      "image_url": null
    }
  ]
}
```

**Field definitions:**
| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `title` | string | Yes | Quiz title shown in lobby |
| `questions` | array | Yes | Array of question objects |
| `questions[].id` | number | Yes | Sequential question ID |
| `questions[].question` | string | Yes | Question text (English or bilingual) |
| `questions[].question_ar` | string | No | Optional Arabic version of question |
| `questions[].choices` | string[] | Yes | Array of 2-5 answer choices |
| `questions[].correct` | number | Yes | **0-indexed** position of the correct answer |
| `questions[].time_limit` | number | No | Seconds allowed per question (default: 20) |
| `questions[].image_url` | string | No | Optional image URL to display with question |

### Method 2: AI-Powered File Conversion (PDF, PPTX, DOCX, etc.)

The host can upload **any document file** containing questions. The system sends it to the **Google Gemini API** which extracts and converts the questions into the JSON schema above.

**Supported file types:** `.pdf`, `.pptx`, `.docx`, `.doc`, `.txt`, `.xlsx`, `.csv`, `.png`, `.jpg` (image of questions)

**Conversion Flow:**
```
Host uploads file (e.g., exam.pdf)
  → Frontend reads file as base64
  → Sends to Supabase Edge Function: convert-questions
  → Edge Function calls Gemini API with:
      - The file (as base64 inline_data or text)
      - A system prompt (see below)
  → Gemini returns structured JSON
  → Edge Function validates the JSON against the schema
  → Returns parsed questions to frontend
  → Host sees a REVIEW/EDIT screen with all extracted questions
  → Host can edit any question, fix errors, remove questions, adjust time limits
  → Host confirms → questions are saved to Question Bank
```

**Gemini System Prompt for Conversion:**
```
You are a medical exam question extractor. You receive a document (PDF, PPTX, DOCX, image, etc.) that contains multiple-choice questions (MCQs).

Your task is to extract ALL questions from the document and return them in this EXACT JSON format. Return ONLY valid JSON, no markdown, no explanation.

{
  "title": "<infer a title from the document content>",
  "questions": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "question": "<the question text in its original language>",
      "question_ar": "<Arabic version if the original is in Arabic, otherwise null>",
      "choices": ["<choice A>", "<choice B>", "<choice C>", "<choice D>"],
      "correct": <0-indexed position of the correct answer>,
      "time_limit": 20,
      "image_url": null
    }
  ]
}

RULES:
1. Extract every single MCQ from the document — do not skip any.
2. The "correct" field must be the 0-based index of the correct answer in the choices array.
3. If the correct answer is marked/highlighted/bolded/starred in the document, use that. If no answer is marked as correct, set "correct" to -1 and the host will manually set it.
4. If the question is in Arabic, put it in both "question" and "question_ar". If in English, put in "question" only.
5. Preserve the original wording of questions and choices exactly as written.
6. If choices are labeled A/B/C/D or 1/2/3/4, remove the labels and just keep the text.
7. Set time_limit to 20 for normal questions, 30 for long/complex ones, 10 for simple recall.
8. Return ONLY the JSON object. No markdown backticks, no commentary.
```

**Edge Function: `convert-questions`**
```js
// Supabase Edge Function
import { GoogleGenerativeAI } from '@google/generative-ai'

const genAI = new GoogleGenerativeAI(Deno.env.get('GEMINI_API_KEY'))

Deno.serve(async (req) => {
  const { file_base64, file_mime_type, file_name } = await req.json()

  const model = genAI.getGenerativeModel({ model: 'gemini-2.0-flash' })

  const result = await model.generateContent([
    { text: SYSTEM_PROMPT }, // the prompt above
    {
      inlineData: {
        mimeType: file_mime_type,
        data: file_base64
      }
    }
  ])

  const responseText = result.response.text()
  const parsed = JSON.parse(responseText)

  // Validate schema
  if (!parsed.title || !Array.isArray(parsed.questions)) {
    return new Response(JSON.stringify({ error: 'Invalid AI response' }), { status: 422 })
  }

  return new Response(JSON.stringify(parsed), {
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }
  })
})
```

**Environment variable needed:**
```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key
```

### Validation Rules (both methods):
- File must produce valid JSON matching the schema
- Must have `title` (string) and `questions` (non-empty array)
- Each question must have `question`, `choices` (min 2), and `correct` (valid index or -1)
- If any question has `correct: -1`, the review screen highlights it in red and forces the host to set the correct answer before saving
- Show clear validation errors in Arabic if anything is malformed

---

## 5. Question Bank System

Every host has a persistent personal question bank stored in Supabase.

### Features:
- **Auto-save:** Every time a host uploads questions (JSON or AI-converted), they're automatically saved to their bank
- **Browse & Search:** Host can browse all their saved question sets, search by title or question text
- **Edit:** Host can open any saved set, edit individual questions (text, choices, correct answer, time limit), add new questions, delete questions
- **Quick Start:** Host can select any saved question set and instantly create a new game room with it — no re-upload needed
- **Delete:** Host can delete entire question sets they no longer need
- **Duplicate:** Host can duplicate a set to create a modified version

### Question Bank UI (Host Dashboard):
```
/host/dashboard
├── "Create New Game" button
├── "Upload Questions" button (JSON or file)
├── Question Bank list:
│   ├── [MSK Anatomy Quiz - Batch 62] — 25 questions — Created: 2026-04-01

```

## 6. Join Request & Approval System

### Flow:
```
Player signs in with Google
  → Enters room code
  → System creates a join_request with status = 'pending'
  → Player sees: "طلبك قيد المراجعة... في انتظار موافقة المضيف" (Your request is under review...)
  → Host sees the request in real-time in the lobby with player's:
      - Google display name
      - Google profile picture
      - Email
  → Host clicks [Accept ✓] or [Reject ✗]
  → IF accepted:
      - join_request.status = 'approved'
      - Player is added to the `players` table
      - Player's UI transitions to the lobby
      - Player appears in the lobby player grid
  → IF rejected:
      - join_request.status = 'rejected'
      - Player sees: "تم رفض طلبك. لا يمكنك الانضمام لهذه المسابقة." (Your request was rejected.)
      - The "Request to Join" button is disabled/hidden
      - Player CANNOT submit another request for this room (enforced by DB unique constraint + status check)
```

### Real-time Updates:
- Host sees new join requests via Supabase Realtime subscription on `join_requests` table (filtered by room_id)
- Player subscribes to their own join_request row to get instant status updates
- Optional: Host can "Accept All" button to bulk-approve all pending requests

## 8. Supabase Realtime Channels Strategy

### Channel: `room:{room_code}`

**Events the host broadcasts:**

| Event | Payload | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `game:start` | `{ total_questions }` | Game has started |
| `question:show` | `{ index, question, choices, time_limit, image_url, question_ar }` | New question (no correct answer sent) |
| `question:lock` | `{ index }` | Time's up, no more answers |
| `question:result` | `{ index, correct, first_player_id, first_player_name, stats }` | Reveal answer + who got it first |
| `leaderboard:update` | `{ rankings: [{player_id, nickname, score, rank}] }` | Updated leaderboard |
| `game:end` | `{ final_rankings }` | Game over |
| `join:approved` | `{ player_id }` | Player approved (sent to specific player) |
| `join:rejected` | `{ player_id }` | Player rejected (sent to specific player) |

**Events players broadcast:**

| Event | Payload | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `player:answered` | `{ player_id, question_index }` | Player submitted answer |
| `player:left` | `{ player_id }` | Player disconnected |

### Presence
```js
const channel = supabase.channel(`room:${roomCode}`)
channel.on('presence', { event: 'sync' }, () => {
  const state = channel.presenceState()
})
channel.subscribe(async (status) => {
  if (status === 'SUBSCRIBED') {
    await channel.track({ player_id, nickname, avatar_url })
  }
})
```

### Join Request Real-time (Host side)
```js
// Host subscribes to new join requests for their room
supabase
  .channel('join-requests')
  .on('postgres_changes', {
    event: 'INSERT',
    schema: 'public',
    table: 'join_requests',
    filter: `room_id=eq.${roomId}`
  }, (payload) => {
    // New join request arrived — show in UI
    addPendingRequest(payload.new)
  })
  .subscribe()
```

### Join Request Real-time (Player side)
```js
// Player subscribes to their own request status
supabase
  .channel('my-request')
  .on('postgres_changes', {
    event: 'UPDATE',
    schema: 'public',
    table: 'join_requests',
    filter: `id=eq.${myRequestId}`
  }, (payload) => {
    if (payload.new.status === 'approved') {
      // Transition to lobby
    } else if (payload.new.status === 'rejected') {
      // Show rejection message, disable rejoin
    }
  })
  .subscribe()
```

## 9. Game Flow (State Machine)

```
LOBBY → PLAYING → FINISHED
         ↕
    (per question cycle):
    QUESTION_SHOWN → ANSWERING → LOCKED → RESULT → (next or FINISHED)
```

### Full Flow Including Auth & Join Requests:

1. **Host signs in with Google** → role verified as host/owner → sees Host Dashboard
2. **Host selects questions** (from bank or new upload) → creates room → gets 6-char code
3. **Players sign in with Google** → enter room code → submit join request
4. **Host sees requests** in real-time → approves or rejects each one
5. **Approved players** enter lobby → appear in player grid via Presence
6. **Rejected players** see rejection message, cannot re-request
7. **Host clicks "Start Game"** → room status = `playing` → broadcasts `game:start`
8. **Host clicks "Next Question"**:
   - Updates `rooms.current_question_index` + `rooms.question_started_at`
   - Broadcasts `question:show` (WITHOUT correct answer)
   - Countdown timer starts
9. **Players answer** → `submit_answer()` RPC → atomic first-correct determination
10. **Timer expires / Host clicks "Lock"** → broadcasts `question:lock`
11. **Host clicks "Reveal"** → broadcasts `question:result` + `leaderboard:update`
12. **Repeat 8-11** until all questions done
13. **Host clicks "End Game"** → `game:end` → final leaderboard + celebration

## 11. UI/UX Design Specifications

### Design Direction: Energetic Medical Gaming

**Theme:** Dark background (#0A0E1A) with neon medical-green (#00F5A0) as primary accent, electric blue (#00D4FF) as secondary, warm amber (#FFB800) for warnings/timers.

**Typography:**
- Display/Headlines: `"Clash Display"` or a bold distinctive display font
- Body/UI: `"Cairo"` (Arabic-first, supports both Arabic and English)
- Monospace (room codes): `"JetBrains Mono"`

**Choice button colors:**
- Choice A: #FF6B6B (red)
- Choice B: #4ECDC4 (teal)
- Choice C: #FFE66D (yellow)
- Choice D: #A78BFA (purple)

**Key patterns:**
- Room code: MASSIVE (8rem+), monospace, glow effect, one-tap copy
- Timer: horizontal bar that shrinks + changes color (green → yellow → red)
- "First correct" celebration: screen flash + gold badge
- RTL throughout (dir="rtl" on Arabic text)
- Mobile-first (players on phones), host view optimized for 1080p+
- Join request cards: player's Google avatar + name + email + approve/reject buttons
- Question review editor: inline editing with save/discard per question

---

## 12. Owner Dashboard Specifications

### Add Host Flow:
```
Owner navigates to /owner/dashboard
  → Sees list of all authorized hosts (email, name, date added, active status)
  → Types a new email in the "Add Host" input
  → Clicks "Add" → email inserted into authorized_hosts
  → If that person has already signed in → their profile.role is updated to 'host'
  → If that person hasn't signed in yet → when they sign in, the trigger assigns role = 'host'
```

### Remove Host Flow:
```
Owner clicks "Remove" next to a host
  → Confirmation dialog: "هل أنت متأكد من إزالة هذا المضيف؟"
  → Sets authorized_hosts.is_active = false
  → Updates profiles.role = 'player' for that email
  → Host can no longer create rooms (existing rooms remain accessible to finish)
```

### Database function to sync role on host add/remove:
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION sync_host_role()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
  IF TG_OP = 'INSERT' OR (TG_OP = 'UPDATE' AND NEW.is_active = true) THEN
    UPDATE profiles SET role = 'host' WHERE email = NEW.email AND role = 'player';
  ELSIF TG_OP = 'UPDATE' AND NEW.is_active = false THEN
    UPDATE profiles SET role = 'player' WHERE email = NEW.email AND role = 'host';
  ELSIF TG_OP = 'DELETE' THEN
    UPDATE profiles SET role = 'player' WHERE email = OLD.email AND role = 'host';
  END IF;
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;

CREATE TRIGGER on_host_change
  AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE OR DELETE ON authorized_hosts
  FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION sync_host_role();
```

## 17. Acceptance Criteria (Definition of Done)

### Auth & Roles
- [ ] Google OAuth sign-in works for all users
- [ ] Owner (sohailcollege2032008@gmail.com) is automatically detected and gets owner role
- [ ] Owner can add/remove host emails from the Owner Dashboard
- [ ] When a new host email is added and that user signs in, they get host role automatically
- [ ] When a host email is removed, that user's role reverts to player
- [ ] Players cannot access host or owner routes (ProtectedRoute enforced)
- [ ] Hosts cannot access owner routes

### Join Request System
- [ ] Players must submit a join request to enter a room
- [ ] Host sees new requests in real-time with player name, email, and avatar
- [ ] Host can approve or reject each request
- [ ] Approved players immediately enter the lobby
- [ ] Rejected players see rejection message and CANNOT re-request
- [ ] "Accept All" bulk-approve works correctly

### Question Upload & AI Conversion
- [ ] Host can upload .json files with correct schema validation
- [ ] Host can upload .pdf, .pptx, .docx, .xlsx, .png, .jpg files
- [ ] Non-JSON files are sent to Gemini API and converted to JSON schema
- [ ] Host sees a review/edit screen after AI conversion
- [ ] Questions with undetected correct answers (correct: -1) are highlighted
- [ ] Host can edit question text, choices, correct answer, and time limit
- [ ] Host must set all correct answers before saving

### Question Bank
- [ ] All uploaded question sets are saved to host's personal bank
- [ ] Host can browse, search, edit, duplicate, and delete question sets
- [ ] Host can start a game directly from a saved question set
- [ ] Question bank persists across sessions

### Game Flow
- [ ] Host can create room and gets 6-character code
- [ ] Questions appear simultaneously for all approved players
- [ ] Countdown timer is synced (±1 second tolerance)
- [ ] First correct answer determined atomically server-side (no race conditions)
- [ ] Player gets immediate feedback
- [ ] Leaderboard updates in real-time
- [ ] Final results with celebration for top 3
- [ ] 100 concurrent players: no crashes, no missed events, no duplicate points

### UI/UX
- [ ] Works on mobile (360px+) and desktop (1080p+)
- [ ] Arabic text renders correctly in RTL
- [ ] No correct answer data leaked to client before reveal
- [ ] Disconnected player can rejoin and resume

---

## 18. Critical Implementation Rules

### DO:
- **Use `submit_answer` RPC** for answer submission — never direct insert
- **Use `process_join_request` RPC** for approving/rejecting — ensures atomic player insertion
- **Broadcast question data WITHOUT correct answer** — only reveal in `question:result`
- **Validate all files on upload** with clear Arabic error messages
- **Use server timestamps** for all time-sensitive operations
- **Store question sets in `question_sets` table** — not just in rooms
- **Check `join_requests` status before allowing re-request** — if rejected, block
- **Support RTL** with `dir="rtl"` and Cairo font throughout
- **Use Google profile data** (name, avatar) for player display

### DON'T:
- **Never send correct answers to clients** before reveal
- **Never trust client-side** "I was first" claims
- **Never allow unauthenticated access** — all users must sign in with Google
- **Never let a non-host create rooms** — enforce via RLS
- **Never let a rejected player re-request** — enforce via DB constraint + UI
- **Don't hardcode the owner check only in frontend** — enforce in RLS policies too
- **Don't allow host to be a player** simultaneously

---

## 19. Performance & Scalability Notes

- **Supabase Free Tier: 200 concurrent Realtime connections** — 100 players + host well within limits
- **Broadcast** (not DB changes) for game events — faster, no DB overhead
- **Advisory locks** in PostgreSQL — handles thousands of concurrent txns, no bottleneck for 100 players
- **Gemini API:** Use `gemini-2.0-flash` for fast file conversion (~2-5 seconds per file)
- **Question bank:** JSONB column is efficient for Postgres, no need for normalized question tables at this scale
- **Keep Realtime payloads small** — send indexes, let clients reference local cache
